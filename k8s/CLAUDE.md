- Address pods using the nginx-lb instead of directly whenever possible
- NEVER modify PVC configurations or Helm values that affect persistent storage without explicitly warning about potential data loss and getting confirmation
- Before making ArgoCD/Helm changes, always check what's currently deployed with `kubectl get` commands
- ArgoCD apps with `prune: true` will DELETE resources that disappear from manifests - be extremely careful
